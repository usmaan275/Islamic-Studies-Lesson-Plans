## 5:10 – 5:15 (5 mins) | Transition & Lesson Aim

**Lesson Objective (share clearly):**
> Today we are answering claims made by non-Muslims about the Qurʾān.  
> By the end, we will show:
> - The Qurʾān is perfectly preserved  
> - Preservation is **textual and oral**  
> - Even the **order** of the Qurʾān shows divine wisdom  

---

## 5:15 – 5:25 (10 mins) | Claim 1: Burning & Standardisation

### Focus: ʿUthmān رضي الله عنه and the burning of manuscripts

**5:15 – 5:20 (5 mins) | Discussion Time:**  
> *Why did ʿUthmān رضي الله عنه order the other Qurʾāns to be burnt?*

**5:20 – 5:25 (5 mins) | Teacher Answers:**
- To ensure later generations would not confuse **Ṣaḥābah personal notes** with the Qurʾān itself
- To establish a **single writing standard**
  - Not just any Arab can write the Qurʾān
  - Everything must be completely correct, even **silent letters** must be written accurately and precisely

---

## 5:25 – 5:40 (15 mins) | Responding to the Main Accusation

### 5:25 – 5:30 (5 mins) | Discussion Time:
> *The claim is: “ʿUthmān رضي الله عنه burnt the Qurʾāns because there were different versions, so he destroyed them to hide differences and finalise his own.”*

### 5:30 – 5:40 (10 mins) | Teacher Answer:

- **Only one copy sent to each major city**
  - Memorisation was the **primary method of preservation**
  - Written copies were only **reference points** when memory failed

- **Could he erase people’s memories?**
  - Thousands had memorised the Qurʾān completely
  - Burning pages does not erase hearts

- **No dots or ḥarakāt in the script:**

<div style="text-align: center;">
  <img src="yasin.png" alt="Yasin Image">
</div>

> Meaning: the **text alone** could not preserve pronunciation.  
> Preservation had to be **oral**.

- **Teacher → student transmission**
  - Students learn Qurʾān by **listening, reciting, and being corrected**
  - Burning manuscripts had **no impact** on this system

- **This system still exists today**
  - Precision down to every syllable
  - A living chain of preservation

**Audio Evidence:** [*Shaykh ʿAbdul Bāsiṭ recitation*](https://youtu.be/96xaseFupmg?si=U-Na_YwixL6tdnUN&t=54)

> Two separate recordings played together  
> Every syllable identical

**Qurʾānic Proof:**
<div style="font-family: 'Scheherazade New', serif; text-align: center; font-size: 30px;">
<p dir="rtl" style="margin-bottom: 0em;">
﴿إِنَّ عَلَیۡنَا جَمۡعَهُۥ وَقُرۡءَانَهُۥ﴾
</p>
<p dir="ltr" style="font-size: 20px; font-style: italic; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">
It is Our duty to ⟨make you⟩ compile and recite it.
</p>
<p dir="ltr" style="font-size: 15px; font-style: italic; margin-top: 0;">
(Sūrah al-Qiyāmah 75:17)
</p>
</div>

## 5:40 – 6:00 (20 mins) | Is the Order of the Qurʾān Divine?

### What Is Certain:
- The **order of the āyāt** is divinely fixed (Ḥadīth)
- Some Sūrahs are clearly paired:
  - Sūrah al-Fīl & Sūrah Quraysh
  - Sūrah al-Falaq & Sūrah al-Nās
- The order we have today is fixed

### 5:40 – 5:45 (5 mins) | Discussion Time:
> *Where did this order come from?*
---

## 5:45 – 6:00 (15 mins) | Teacher Answer:
### 5:45 – 5:50 (5 mins) | Spiritual Argument: Structure, System, Order

Allah created the universe with breathtaking **structure**, **system**, and **order**.

- The sun is about **400 times larger** than the moon  
- The sun is also about **400 times further away**  
  → This precise ratio causes them to appear the **same size** in the sky, allowing for total solar eclipses

- Earth sits in an extremely narrow **habitable zone**
  - Slightly closer to the sun and oceans would evaporate
  - Slightly further and the planet would freeze
  - This balance allows liquid water — essential for life

- The laws governing the universe are finely tuned:
  - Gravity strong enough to form stars but not collapse the universe
  - Atmospheric pressure that allows breathing
  - Oxygen levels that sustain life without constant combustion

- Biological systems show layers of design:
  - DNA carries vast information in microscopic space
  - Cells self-repair and replicate with precision
  - Ecosystems depend on balance — remove one element and systems collapse

This is not randomness.  
This is **structure, system, and order** embedded into creation itself.

If Allah placed such flawless order in His creation:
- the heavens
- the earth
- life at every scale  

### Then why would He not also place that structure, system, and order in **His words**?

---

### 5:50 – 5:55 (5 mins) | Logical Argument
- Humans naturally disagree
- It would be impossible for **thousands of Ṣaḥābah** to unanimously agree on one order without proof

### *How many possible combinations are there?*

<div dir="ltr">
<details>
<summary><strong>114! Mathematical Proof</strong></summary>

There are **114 Sūrahs** in the Qurʾān.

That means there are **114!** possible orders.

114! ≈ **2.5 × 10¹⁸⁶**

Imagine a timer counting down 114! seconds:

- Walk one step around the Earth, then wait **one trillion years**
- After each full lap, remove **one drop from the ocean**
- After emptying the ocean, pick up **one grain of sand**
- After all sand, cut **one blade of grass**
- After all grass, stack paper **until it reaches the sun**
- After each stack, count **one atom in the observable universe**
- Finish counting → earn £1 → repeat everything

You could do this **3457 times**  
And still not finish the timer.

That’s how many possible Qurʾān orders exist.  
Yet the entire Muslim world has **one**.

</details>
</div>

#### Patterns that *wouldn't* exist if humans chose the order:
- All **الر** Sūrahs together (10–15)
- All **حم** Sūrahs together (40–46)

But:
- Sūrahs beginning with **الم** are split (2–3 and 29–32)
- Size order exists — but imperfectly

This does not reflect a normal human organising pattern.

### 5:55 – 5:57 (2 mins) | Historical Evidence
- The Prophet ﷺ recited the **entire Qurʾān** to Jibrīl عليه السلام shortly before his death
- The Ṣaḥābah knew this and narrated it
- Their solution would be obvious:
  - Use the **same order** the Prophet ﷺ used
- From the Messenger ﷺ = **a message from Allah**

---

### 5:57 – 6:00 (3 mins) | Qurʾānic Internal Evidence: Sūrah Connections

- **Sūrah al-Fātiḥah:** اهدنا  
  **Sūrah al-Baqarah:** هدى  

- **Sūrah Āl ʿImrān:** واتقوا الله لعلكم تفلحون  
  **Sūrah al-Nisāʾ:** اتقوا ربكم  

- **Sūrah al-Isrāʾ:** قل الحمد لله  
  **Sūrah al-Kahf:** الحمد لله  

- **Sūrah Maryam:** يسرناه بلسانك  
  **Sūrah Ṭāhā:** ما أنزلنا عليك القرآن لتشقى  

- **Sūrah al-Ṭūr:** وإدبار النجوم  
  **Sūrah al-Najm:** والنجم إذا هوى  

---

## 6:00 – 6:10 (10 mins) | Final Discussion & Close

**Discussion: Sūrah al-Fīl & Sūrah Quraysh**

- Sūrah al-Fīl describes the destruction of **Abrahah’s plan**
- Abrahah aimed to:
  - Destroy the Kaʿbah
  - Undermine Makkah’s religious prestige
  - Collapse Quraysh’s economic and political power

**Why Makkah’s rise bothered Abrahah:**
- Religious competition: redirect pilgrimage to his cathedral
- Economic power:
  - caravans
  - markets
  - seasonal trade
- Political influence:
  - control trade routes
  - prevent Makkah becoming a rival centre

**After the failed attack:**
- Abrahah lost respect as his attack failed miserably
- He also died
- No one dared to avenge him as his empire were now scared of battle
- His empire's control over Arabian cities and Arabian trade routes collapsed
- Specifically they lost control of Yemen
- Then his empire was conquered by the Persians
- So now Makkah emerged with:
  - no southern threat (free to trade with Yemen now)
  - no northern threat
  - full control of trade routes

**Result:**  
The **īlāf of Quraysh** was established — winter and summer caravans flourished.

**Then discuss:**
- Difference between **Sūrah al-Falaq & Sūrah al-Nās**
  - al-Falaq → protection from **external** threats
  - al-Nās → protection from **internal** threats

---

**Final Message:**
> The Qurʾān is preserved  
> In text, in memory, in sound, and in structure  
> This is not just history — it is **living evidence**

# Year 9 Islamic Studies — Lesson Plan  
**Topic:** The Khilāfah of ʿAlī ibn Abī Ṭālib رضي الله عنه  
**Focus:** His virtue, the situation after ʿUthmān, key events of his khilāfah, and why the Rashidūn era ends with him  
**Time:** 5:00 – 6:10 (70 minutes)

---

## 5:00 – 5:10 (10 mins) | Starter Activity (Late Arrivals Expected)

### Starter Question
- What do you already know about **ʿAlī رضي الله عنه**?

**Teacher note:**  
Allow students **5 minutes** to discuss in pairs or small groups (4–5 students).  
This is not assessed. The aim is to surface prior knowledge, misconceptions, and confidence levels before formal teaching begins.

---

## 5:10 – 5:30 (20 mins) | Background of ʿAlī رضي الله عنه (Virtue & Formation)

### 1. His Upbringing & Early Islam (5 mins)
- Son of **Abū Ṭālib**, the Prophet’s ﷺ uncle  
- Raised **inside the household of the Prophet ﷺ**
- Witnessed Islam from its very beginning
- Accepted Islam **as a young child**, making him one of the earliest Muslims
- Grew up surrounded by:
  - sincerity in worship  
  - honesty in speech  
  - sacrifice for truth  
  - reliance upon Allah  

**Teacher emphasis:**  
His Islam was not cultural or inherited — it was a **conscious, early commitment**.

---

### 2. Courage, Loyalty & Sacrifice (5 mins)
- Slept in the Prophet’s ﷺ bed during the hijrah, fully aware of the danger
- Returned trusts to those who were actively trying to kill the Prophet ﷺ
- Travelled to Madīnah **alone and on foot**
- Became known among the Ṣaḥābah for:
  - exceptional bravery  
  - absolute loyalty  
  - willingness to sacrifice personal safety  

**Teacher emphasis:**  
These qualities shape the kind of leader he later becomes.

---

### 3. Knowledge, Justice & Character (5 mins)
- Known for deep **knowledge** of Islam and sound judgement
- Famous for his **commitment to justice**, even when it harmed his own interests
- Lived simply and rejected luxury
- Expected accountability from himself before others

**Teacher emphasis:**  
This strong sense of justice will later place him in extremely difficult situations as khalīfah.

---

### 4. Ahl al-Sunnah Disclaimer (5 mins)
**State clearly and calmly:**
- As **Ahl al-Sunnah**, we:
  - Love ʿAlī رضي الله عنه
  - Honour his closeness to the Prophet ﷺ
  - Acknowledge his immense virtue and status
- We also affirm the correct order of the khulafāʾ:
  - Abū Bakr  
  - ʿUmar  
  - ʿUthmān  
  - ʿAlī  

**Teacher emphasis:**  
Loving ʿAlī does not mean exaggeration, and respecting the other Ṣaḥābah does not reduce his status.

---

## 5:30 – 5:40 (10 mins) | Recap: The First Three Khalīfahs

### Brief Timeline Reminder
- **Abū Bakr رضي الله عنه**
  - Faced apostasy and rebellion
  - Preserved unity at the most fragile moment
- **ʿUmar رضي الله عنه**
  - Oversaw massive expansion
  - Established strong systems of governance
- **ʿUthmān رضي الله عنه**
  - Standardised the Qurʾān
  - Faced growing criticism and unrest
  - Assassinated in 656 CE

---

### Discussion Time (5 mins)
> After the murder of a khalīfah, what kinds of problems are almost guaranteed to follow?

**Teacher guidance / model answer:**
- There is no clear authority everyone agrees upon
- Emotions are extremely high and people want immediate action
- Different groups blame each other
- Rumours spread quickly
- Some people seek justice, others seek power, and others seek revenge
- Rebels are already active and armed
- Trust between Muslims begins to break down

**Teacher emphasis:**  
This is the **unstable, fractured situation** that ʿAlī رضي الله عنه **inherits** — not a situation he causes.

---

## 5:40 – 6:10 (30 mins) | Main Lesson: The Khilāfah of ʿAlī رضي الله عنه

---

### 1. Reading Time (5:40 – 5:50 | 10 mins)

Get a student or students to read the textbook loudly to the class:

**Teacher role:**
- Help with difficult vocabulary
- Ask questions throughout. Prompt students to notice *why* events unfolded, not just *what* happened

---

### 2. Guided Discussion: Key Events of His Khilāfah (5:50 – 6:05 | 15 mins)

#### Discussion Time 1: Why ʿAlī Accepted the Khilāfah
- Leadership was urgently needed to prevent total collapse
- Madīnah was no longer safe or united
- Refusing leadership could have made the situation even worse
- He accepted responsibility despite knowing the risks

**Teacher emphasis:**  
This was leadership taken out of **duty**, not desire.

---

#### Discussion Time 2: Justice for ʿUthmān رضي الله عنه
- Many demanded immediate punishment for the killers
- ʿAlī insisted justice must be:
  - lawful  
  - evidence-based  
  - carried out once stability returned  
- Delaying punishment was seen by some as weakness, even though it was principled

**Teacher emphasis:**  
This was a disagreement over **method**, not belief.

---

#### Discussion Time 3: Internal Conflict
- Different groups rose up, each claiming to act for justice
- Emotions and anger overpowered calm judgement
- Attempts at peace were made but often sabotaged
- Muslims ended up fighting Muslims

**Teacher emphasis:**  
Once unity cracks, even sincere people can end up on opposite sides.

---

#### Discussion Time 4: Authority Weakens
- Political manoeuvres replaced sincerity
- Some used religious symbols for worldly aims
- ʿAlī’s moral authority remained strong, but political authority weakened
- Extremist groups emerged, rejecting compromise entirely

**Teacher emphasis:**  
This period shows how chaos allows extremism to grow.

---

### 3. The End of His Khilāfah & Its Meaning (6:05 – 6:10 | 5 mins)

- Assassinated in Ramaḍān 661 CE while praying
- Killed by an extremist
- His death marked a turning point:
  - unity could not be restored
  - leadership shifted to dynastic rule
  - the era of the Rightly Guided Khilāfahs effectively ended

**Final Teacher Reflection:**
> ʿAlī رضي الله عنه did not fail because he lacked ability.  
> He ruled in a time where justice alone could no longer hold together a deeply fractured ummah.

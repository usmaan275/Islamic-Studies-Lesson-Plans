## FULL REVISION LESSON (Teacher Delivery + Model Answers)

**Date:** Friday 16th January 2026  
**Class:** Year 9  
**Purpose:** To revise all content covered so far and prepare students fully for the end-of-unit assessment.

## 5:00 – 5:25 | REVISION BLOCK 1  
## WHY AM I A MUSLIM?

Students must be able to explain this **without comparing to other religions**, clearly structured into **three sections**.

---

## SECTION 1: ALLĀH — PAST, PRESENT, FUTURE (3 MARKS)

### **PAST — CREATION & DESIGN**

Ask the students to reflect:

Look at the universe around us. Look at the sky, the planets, the stars, the laws of physics.  
Everything follows a system. Everything follows rules. Nothing is random.

How is it possible that something so perfectly structured came into existence **by itself**?  
How could something with laws, consistency, balance, and precision appear without a **Designer**?

Nothing in our daily lives works like that.  
A phone needs a maker. A building needs an architect.  
So how could the universe — far more complex than any of these — exist without a Creator?

This past creation points clearly to **Allāh**, the One who planned, measured, and brought everything into existence.

---

### **PRESENT — SUSTENANCE & CONTROL**

People think that certain things automatically give results.

We think:
- When we eat, we *gain nourishment*
- When we sleep, we *gain energy*
- When we sit in the sun, we *gain warmth*

But ask yourself honestly:

Has anyone here ever eaten and **still felt hungry**?
Has anyone slept for hours and **still woken up tired**?
Has anyone been in the sun and **still felt cold**?

So food itself doesn’t guarantee nourishment.
Sleep itself doesn’t guarantee rest.
The sun itself doesn’t guarantee warmth.

These things only benefit us **when Allāh allows them to**.

Every breath we take, every heartbeat, every moment of strength or weakness is under the command of Allāh.  
He is sustaining us **right now**, even when we don’t realise it.

---

### **FUTURE — DEATH & THE SOUL**

When a person dies, what actually leaves the body?

The legs are still there — but they cannot walk.  
The eyes are still there — but they cannot see.  
The ears are still there — but they cannot hear.

So what changed?

The body is still present, but **the soul has been taken**.

That shows us something important:  
You are not the body.  
The body is just a container.

Once the soul leaves, what we used to call “me” becomes “the body”.

That soul will return to the One who placed it there in the first place — Allāh.

And based on the decisions it made in this life, it will either:
- Return close to its true home, near Allāh’s mercy  
or
- Be kept distant from Him — just as it chose distance in this life

---

## SECTION 2: THE QURʾĀN (3 MARKS)

The Qurʾān alone is enough as proof of Islam.

Students may mention **any three** of the following:

- It has been **perfectly preserved**, letter for letter, memorised by millions
- Its **language** could not be matched by the greatest Arab poets
- It contains **scientific facts** unknown at the time of revelation
- It accurately describes **historical events**
- It made **prophecies** that later came true
- It was revealed over **23 years** yet remains consistent and coherent

No human book in history comes close to this.

---

## SECTION 3: THE PROPHET MUḤAMMAD ﷺ (3 MARKS)

When we look at the life of the Prophet Muḥammad ﷺ, we are forced to ask a very serious question:

**Who was this man really?**

There are only a few logical possibilities.

Either:
- He was lying
- He was deluded
- He was influenced by something evil
- Or he was telling the truth

Let’s go through this carefully.

---

### HIS CHARACTER (AKHLĀQ)

Before prophethood, even his enemies called him **al-Amīn** — the trustworthy one.

He never lied.
He never cheated.
He never broke promises.

When people in Makkah argued, they trusted *him* to judge.
When people travelled, they trusted *him* with their belongings.

Now ask yourself:
Would a man known for honesty suddenly invent the biggest lie in human history — and then suffer for it for 23 years?

---

### HOW HE DEALT WITH ENEMIES

Look at how he treated those who harmed him.

- He was mocked, beaten, and insulted
- He was driven out of his home
- His companions were tortured and killed

Yet when he finally returned to Makkah **with power**, what did he do?

Did he take revenge?
Did he order executions?
Did he punish those who hurt him?

No.

He said:
> “Go, for you are free.”

No leader in history behaves like this unless they are guided by something greater than themselves.

---

### HIS MIRACLES

The Prophet ﷺ was supported with miracles, including:

- The **splitting of the moon**
- Water flowing from his fingers
- Food increasing to feed large groups
- Supplications being accepted immediately

These were witnessed by many companions and transmitted through reliable chains.

---

### HIS PROPHECIES

The Prophet ﷺ made predictions that later came true, including:

- The defeat and later **victory of the Romans**
- That Islam would spread across Arabia and beyond
- That certain companions would be martyred
- That corrupt leadership and division would appear after his time

He described events that no ordinary human could have known — and history confirmed them.

---

### HIS SEERAH & IMPACT

In just 23 years:
- He transformed idol worshippers into worshippers of One God
- He ended tribal hatred and replaced it with brotherhood
- He established law, ethics, worship, and governance
- He changed the course of world history forever

No teacher, philosopher, or ruler has ever had an impact like this.

---

### THE ONLY LOGICAL CONCLUSION

He was not lying.
He was not deluded.
He was not influenced by evil.

The only explanation that fits **his character**, **his miracles**, **his prophecies**, **his mercy**, and **his legacy** is this:

**Muḥammad ﷺ was truly the Messenger of Allāh.**

And that is why we are Muslim.

## 5:35 – 6:10 | REVISION BLOCK 3  
## ISLAMIC HISTORY (CHRONOLOGICAL)

---

## ABŪ BAKR AṢ-ṢIDDĪQ رضي الله عنه

**Defining Characteristic:** Unshakeable faith

When the Prophet ﷺ passed away, many people left Islam.  
Abū Bakr stood firm and said:

> “Whoever worshipped Muḥammad — Muḥammad has died.  
> Whoever worships Allāh — Allāh is alive and never dies.”

He preserved Islam at its most fragile moment.

---

### Responding to the Claim:  
> “ʿAlī should have been the first Khalīfah”

- The Companions unanimously chose Abū Bakr
- ʿAlī himself gave allegiance
- Unity was prioritised
- Leadership was based on merit, not lineage

---

## ʿUMAR IBN AL-KHAṬṬĀB رضي الله عنه

- Migrated **openly**, challenging anyone to stop him
- Empire expanded massively
- Personally visited **Jerusalem**

Established systems still used today:
- Courts and judges
- Police force
- Welfare for the poor
- Administrative governance

---

## ʿUTHMĀN IBN ʿAFFĀN رضي الله عنه

### Qurʾān Preservation
- Compiled under Abū Bakr
- Passed to ʿUmar
- Then to Ḥafṣah
- Standardised under ʿUthmān

He burned personal manuscripts **to protect unity**, not to change the Qurʾān.

### Martyrdom
- Foretold by the Prophet ﷺ
- Saw dreams confirming it
- Continued fasting calmly

### Duʿās of His Wife
- That the attacker's hand be paralysed
- That he goes blind
- That he is never forgiven

All were seemingly accepted.

---

## ʿALĪ IBN ABĪ ṬĀLIB رضي الله عنه

- Faced civil war and internal division
- Disagreed with Muʿāwiyah on **timing of justice**
- Assassinated while praying

Marked the end of the Rightly Guided Caliphate.

---

## AFTER ʿALĪ رضي الله عنه

Students may name:
- Umayyad Empire
- Abbasid Empire
- Andalusia
- Ottoman Empire
- Mughal Empire

---

## FINAL CLOSING

- Abū Bakr: Stabilised Islam  
- ʿUmar: Built civilisation  - Expanded the ummah
- ʿUthmān: Preserved the Qurʾān  - Tried to control emerging fitnah
- ʿAlī: Tested by division  

**Lesson takeaway:**  
Allāh preserves His religion through belief, sacrifice, leadership, and truth — and every generation must carry that responsibility.

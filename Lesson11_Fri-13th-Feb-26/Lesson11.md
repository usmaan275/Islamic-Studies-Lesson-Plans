## 5:00 – 5:05 | Opening Reflection — Ramadan Is Coming

### Teacher Opening
Ask students:
- How many days until Ramadan?
- What do you usually think about when Ramadan comes?
  - Food?
  - Long fasts?
  - Sleep?

### Key Message
Many people think Ramadan is:
- Hard
- Long
- Restrictive

But believers understand:
> Ramadan is **not a burden — it is a blessing**.

Allah chose *us* to witness it.
Not everyone who saw last Ramadan is alive today.

**Reflection Question:**
> What if this Ramadan is your last one?

## 5:05 – 5:10 | Ramadan Is a Guest

### Teaching Analogy
Ramadan is like a very honoured guest visiting your home.

Ask students:
- When a special guest comes, what do families do?

Expected answers:
- Clean the house
- Plan meals
- Prepare activities
- Make time for them

Then say:

The greater the guest,
the more preparation we do.

Ramadan is the guest that:
- Changes destinies
- Erases sins
- Raises ranks

But many people:
- Prepare samosas
- Prepare desserts
- Prepare sleep schedules

Yet do **not** prepare their hearts.

## 5:10 – 5:15 | Purpose of Ramadan — Not Just Hunger

### Qurʾān
Recite or show:

> يَا أَيُّهَا الَّذِينَ آمَنُوا كُتِبَ عَلَيْكُمُ الصِّيَامُ  
> كَمَا كُتِبَ عَلَى الَّذِينَ مِنْ قَبْلِكُمْ  
> لَعَلَّكُمْ تَتَّقُونَ  
> (Ṣūrah al-Baqarah 2:183)

Meaning:
Fasting was prescribed so that you may develop **taqwā**.

Explain simply:
- Taqwā = awareness that Allah is watching
- Controlling yourself even when nobody sees

### Powerful Ḥadīth Reminders
Say to students:

Some people fast…
but gain nothing except hunger and thirst.

The Prophet ﷺ said:
Whoever does not leave false speech and ignorant behaviour,
Allah has no need for him to leave his food and drink.

Meaning:
- Ramadan is not just about stomachs
- Ramadan is about hearts and behaviour

Ask:
> What’s the point of fasting if our character stays the same?

## 5:15 – 5:20 | Setting Ramadan Goals

Tell students:
Ramadan success does **not happen accidentally**.
It happens with intention and planning.

### Example Goals
- Read Qurʾān daily (even small amounts)
- Lower the gaze
- Control anger
- Speak less nonsense
- Help parents more
- Help mum in the kitchen
- Even suggest making less food to avoid waste

Explain:
Real success = small consistent change.

Ask students:
> What is ONE thing you know you need to fix this Ramadan?

---

## 5:20 – 5:25 | Managing Time — Ramadan Timetable

Explain:
Without a plan, Ramadan disappears.

Discuss:
- School
- Homework
- Worship
- Rest
- Family time

Encourage:
Make a simple daily structure:
- After Fajr → Qurʾān or dhikr
- After school → short rest
- Before Maghrib → duʿāʾ time
- After Tarāwīḥ → avoid pointless scrolling

Say:
People say “Ramadan went so fast.”
But really —
they never controlled their time.

---

## 5:25 – 5:28 | Family Ramadan

Encourage family worship:
- Pray together
- Eat together
- Make duʿāʾ together
- Read Qurʾān together

Explain:
Barakah increases when worship is shared.

Ramadan is not just a personal journey —
it’s a family transformation.

---

## 5:28 – 5:30 | Don’t Stop After Ramadan

Ask students:
Why do some people change in Ramadan…
then go back after Eid?

Explain:
The goal is not a **temporary Muslim**.

Ramadan is training.
Ramadan is a reset.
Ramadan is practice for the rest of life.

If you start:
- Qurʾān
- Good speech
- Lowered gaze
- Kindness to parents

Carry at least **one habit** beyond Ramadan.

Because:
Allah is the Lord of Ramadan…
and the Lord of every month.

## 5:30 onwards | Islamic Articulate Game

- Split into teams
- Reinforce Islamic vocabulary & history
- Keep atmosphere positive and energetic

End lesson with reminder of duʿāʾ:
> O Allah allow us to reach Ramadan,
> benefit from Ramadan,
> and leave Ramadan forgiven.
